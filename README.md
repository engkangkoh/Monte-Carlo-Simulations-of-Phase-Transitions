# Monte-Carlo-Simulations-of-Phase-Transitions
Lab Project from SPMS, NTUsg. 
This computational experiment introduces students to the Monte Carlo in statistical physics. Students will 
a) understand the basic principles of the Monte Carlo method; 

b) familiarize with a Monte Carlo code for the investigation of a phase transition, such as the liquid-gas phase transition, 
or the Ising model, or other transitions proposed by the students. 

c) use the code to answer selected questions. Students that complete this experiment will be able, in the future, 
to write their own Monte Carlo code to investigate problems they might be interested in.
